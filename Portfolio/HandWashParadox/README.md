# 🧼 The Handwashing Paradox  
This is a self-driven project where I revisited a famous historical medical case — Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis’ discovery that handwashing drastically reduced maternal deaths in the 1840s.  
My goal wasn’t just to retell history, but to practice **end-to-end data analysis**: from wrangling raw data, to SQL queries and statistical testing, all the way to visual storytelling.  

## 🔎 What I Worked On  
- **Data wrangling & cleaning:** loading annual/monthly hospital records, calculating mortality rates.  
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA):** comparing clinics, visualizing trends, and marking interventions.  
- **SQL integration:** writing queries inside Python to calculate totals and compare before/after periods.  
- **Statistical testing:** running a two-sample T-test to check if mortality reduction was significant.  
- **Visualization & storytelling:** creating clear charts (line plots, annotated turning points, bar charts) and tying them together in a notebook narrative.  

## 📚 What I Learned  
- How to structure a data project from start to finish (not just isolated code snippets).  
- How EDA, SQL, and hypothesis testing can complement each other.  
- The value of framing results in a **story** — it makes the analysis more memorable than just numbers.  
- That even a **historical dataset** can be used to show modern skills like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`.
