# 🔍 Google Search vs Reality

## Overview / What I Did
- Compared how people search on Google with what actually happens in the real world — Tesla stock prices, Bitcoin value, and unemployment rates.
- Tried to see if what people search for online can reflect or even hint at real trends.

## How
**Data Handling:** Cleaned and organized monthly data from Google Trends, stock prices, and government reports.
**Trend Comparison:** Plotted search interest against real data to see how closely they move together.
**Relationship Check:** Measured how strong the connection is between the two:
– Tesla: 0.74 → when Tesla searches go up, price mostly goes up too.
– Bitcoin: 0.64 → searches and price rise and fall in a similar way.
– Unemployment: 0.71 → more searches for “unemployment benefits” when real unemployment rises.
**Visualization:** Used clear line graphs with dual axes to show how public attention often predicts real-world changes.

## Impact
- Proved that Google searches often mirror what’s happening or about to happen in reality.
- Showed that people’s online behavior can act as an early signal for market and economic changes.

## Tools / Skills Used
- Python: pandas, matplotlib
- Data Cleaning: dates, merging, monthly grouping
- Analysis: trend matching, real-world comparison
- Visualization: time-series, dual-axis charts
- Environment: Google Colab, GitHub
