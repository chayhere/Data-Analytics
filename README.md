# ✨ Data Analytics Portfolio

🌊Python, 🪨Sheets, 🔥SQL, and 💨Visualization. Long ago, the 4 elements shaped Data with clarity.
Then, everything changed when data got chaotic. Only the **Data Avatar**, master of all 4 elements, could bring balance and insight.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
To become the next Data Avatar, though having great motivation and curiosity, I still have much to learn like SQL, Sheets, Python... before tackling real world data analysis.
<br>
In this repository, I document projects I’ve built learning Data Analytics, capturing my learnings from the basics to mastering the four elements.<br>
